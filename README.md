# etch-a-sketch
# The goal of this project will to create something that is a mix between an etch-a-sketch and sketchpad.
# Upon loading the webpage a collection of divs in a 16x16 grid should be in a container on the page. 
# Either by mousing over or clicking (haven't decided which) inside of the divs it should change their color until reset.
